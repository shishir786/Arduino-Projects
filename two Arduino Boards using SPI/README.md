# Arduino SPI Communication Project

This project demonstrates how to use SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) communication between two Arduino Uno boards. In this example, one Arduino is the master, and the other acts as the slave. The setup includes basic components such as LEDs, push buttons, and resistors.

## Components Required

- **Arduino UNO (2)**: Two Arduino boards to establish SPI communication.
- **LED (2)**: Two LEDs used to indicate the status of communication.
- **Push Button (2)**: Buttons to trigger communication between the master and slave.
- **Resistors (10k, 2.2k)**: Resistors to control current and avoid damage to components.
- **Breadboard**: Used to build the circuit for connecting all components.
- **Connecting Wires**: To make the necessary connections between components.

## Circuit Diagram

Below is the circuit diagram showing how to use SPI communication on Arduino UNO. The setup remains the same for Arduino Mega or Arduino Nano, with the only difference being the pin numbers. You can check the pinouts for those boards to ensure the correct connections.

### Pin Mapping (Arduino UNO):
- **Master Arduino (UNO)**:
  - **MOSI (Master Out Slave In)**: Pin 11
  - **MISO (Master In Slave Out)**: Pin 12
  - **SCK (Serial Clock)**: Pin 13
  - **SS (Slave Select)**: Pin 10

- **Slave Arduino (UNO)**:
  - **MOSI**: Pin 11
  - **MISO**: Pin 12
  - **SCK**: Pin 13
  - **SS**: Pin 10

Note: The pin numbers for Arduino Mega or Nano might be different, so refer to their respective pinout diagrams.

## Working of the Circuit

### Master Arduino:
- Sends data to the slave Arduino using the SPI protocol.
- Controls the LEDs and communicates the status to the slave Arduino based on button presses.

### Slave Arduino:
- Receives data from the master Arduino and controls its LED based on the received data.
- Sends feedback to the master Arduino, triggering an action (e.g., LED on/off).

### SPI Communication:
- **MOSI (Master Out Slave In)**: The master sends data to the slave through this pin.
- **MISO (Master In Slave Out)**: The slave sends data back to the master through this pin.
- **SCK (Serial Clock)**: A clock signal generated by the master that synchronizes data transfer between the master and slave.
- **SS (Slave Select)**: Used by the master to select which slave device is active for communication.

## How to Use

1. **Connect the Components**: Set up the components as per the circuit diagram above, ensuring all connections are correct.
2. **Upload the Code**: Upload the provided Arduino code to the master and slave Arduino boards.
3. **Observe the LEDs**: Once the system is running, press the push buttons to trigger SPI communication. You should see the LEDs lighting up based on the data transfer.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of SPI communication in Arduino-based systems. By following the above steps and using the components listed, you can establish reliable communication between two Arduino boards for various applications.
