## Overview

This repository contains various projects developed using Arduino boards. The projects utilize sensors, actuators, and communication protocols like SPI, I2C, and UART to create innovative solutions and learnings. Each project has its own folder, containing the necessary files and explanations to set up and run the project.

## Components Required

The components required for various projects are listed in each project's specific folder. However, here is a general list of commonly used components:

- **Arduino UNO / Mega / Nano**
- **LEDs**
- **Push Buttons**
- **Sensors** (e.g., temperature, humidity, motion)
- **Resistors** (e.g., 10kΩ, 220Ω)
- **Breadboard**
- **Connecting Wires**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Motor Driver (for motor-related projects)**

## Circuit Diagram

Each project folder contains a circuit diagram for setting up the components. The diagrams are typically created using tools like Fritzing or other electronics design tools, and you can follow them to replicate the setup.

Note: If you are working on a specific project, refer to the `circuit_diagram.png` or equivalent in the respective folder for detailed wiring and pin connections.

## How to Use

### Setting Up the Arduino

1. **Connect the Components**: Refer to the circuit diagram for the specific project and connect the components to the Arduino board.
2. **Upload the Code**: Upload the provided Arduino code to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE. Ensure that you select the correct board type and port in the IDE.
3. **Testing**: After uploading the code, you can test the setup by interacting with the components. For example:
    - Press buttons to trigger actions.
    - Observe LED responses.
    - Read sensor data displayed in the Serial Monitor.

### Example Project

1. **Master-Slave SPI Communication**: One of the popular projects in this repository involves establishing SPI communication between two Arduino boards (Master and Slave). This project demonstrates the use of MOSI, MISO, SCK, and SS pins for communication.

    - **Master**: Sends data to the Slave Arduino using SPI.
    - **Slave**: Receives data from the Master and triggers the appropriate response (e.g., LED on/off).

    Follow the instructions in the specific project folder for code and setup.
