## 📖 Overview

This repository contains various projects developed using Arduino boards. The projects utilize sensors, actuators, and communication protocols like SPI, I2C, and UART to create innovative solutions and learnings. Each project has its own folder, containing the necessary files and explanations to set up and run the project. 💡

## 🧰 Components Required

The components required for various projects are listed in each project's specific folder. However, here is a general list of commonly used components:

- **Arduino UNO / Mega / Nano** ⚙️
- **LEDs** 💡
- **Push Buttons** 🕹️
- **Sensors** (e.g., temperature, humidity, motion) 🌡️
- **Resistors** (e.g., 10kΩ, 220Ω) 🔌
- **Breadboard** 🧱
- **Connecting Wires** 🔗
- **Jumper Wires** 🧑‍🔬
- **Motor Driver** (for motor-related projects) 🔄

## 📐 Circuit Diagram

Each project folder contains a circuit diagram for setting up the components. The diagrams are typically created using tools like Fritzing or other electronics design tools, and you can follow them to replicate the setup. 🖼️
